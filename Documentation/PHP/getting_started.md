# Auther - PHP

**Auther** documentation for PHP.

## Installation

Auther is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/) (using semantic versioning), and installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install Auther. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:

```json
"auther/auther": "~1.0"
```

or run

```sh
composer require auther/auther
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of Auther.

## Getting Started

If you do not already have your database setup start with the [beginners guide](beginners_guide.md)

```php
// Instantiate the Auther class
$auther = new Auther();

// Authenticate a user
$authenticate = $auther->authenticate($user, $password);

// Get authenticated user
$authenticated = $Auther->getAuthenticated();
```
